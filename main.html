        This page is all about sharing stuff which I find interesting.
        By the way I am Mayank, I am an engineer by profession, but presently on
        a sabitical and working on myself. Basically learning and growing, and in 
        this journey would be sharing stuff here, raw and unfiltered, though I will
        try of occasionally add my superficial aesthetic get into way and make stuff 
        a little bit spicy, but not to worry mostly it will by unfiltered. 
        When I say unfiltered, I don't mean anything and everything would be shared 
        only stuff which I will think worth sharing would make its place here. 
        Not to make things dramatic any further lets' have this site up and kicking!
