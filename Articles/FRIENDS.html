    <h1>FRIENDS TV SHOW</h1>
    <h3>I feel like we(individual people) are nothing but constantly changing hats based on friends characters.</h3>
    <p>There are times when I geek about stuff like Ross and times when I am hyper organised like Monica. I try to be hilarious at times like Chandler and be like Joey when it comes to being around women. I am not a fashionista but there are times when social media makes me makeover my warddrove like Rachel. I goof in and out and is weird in my own ways like Phoebe.</p>
    <p>Well I will put some of the characters characteristics and dialogues which I associated with : </p>
    <div>
        <p>JOEY</p>
        <p>Presently I am reading a lot and I feel like talking about these stuff, remember that episode where Joey bought an encyclopedia and learnt about stuff from a single letter. That what I feel like, talk about Articles I read and I know.</p>
        <p>Initially I didn't saw Joey's character much interesting, infact I thought he was annoying. But I feel there is something about him that I can associte to, like for instance that episode where he moves to a new place and he wanted to get back with Chandler, and he said I thought I would be alone and think about my thoughts but I don't have as many thoughts as I thought I would have. This is me sometimes, I thought I would write and have all these different stuff but I don't, what I have is a repetition of usual thought and so in order to keep myself filled I need to read more. But I lack the confidence to admit it while Joey just says it upfront.</p>
