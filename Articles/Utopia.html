    <p>These three pictures were captured by me, its an early morning picture, it was cloudy and even drizzles of rain could be felt.</p>
    <p>What reminds us of utopia, a sense of a place in the future where things are abandoned and something tragic took place which resulted into societies going into chaos. The pictures which I have captured gives us a sense of similar feeling though nothing of that sort has taken place, its just an early morning where people are not buzzing on the streets and there is a sense of calmness, added to it is the gloomy dark cloud cover which makes it a perfect scene for utopia. 
    <br><br>
        I am also very much fond of infrastructure, whereever I go, awestruck and calmed (dilemma), at the same time with the structures we humans have developed. Mega structures and mega machines all creating these amazingly looking edifices all around. 
        <br><br>
        My sense of utopia is inspired by a number of movies and tv shows, for example, the show "The 100", in the show we see that after post apocalyptic scenario, the ruins are left and there is this building, a tall building, inhabited by ruler who rules the kingdom, this building is destroyed yet has a sense of Power and a Queen looking over her empire, far stretched. <br>
        In the movie 'I am Legend' staring Will Smith, we see the society collapsed with the wide spread of some virus and people became zombies. In this post apocalyptic scenario as well we see all the infrastructure all around, but the common theme is the silence that covers the roads and shops and buildings. This shows us that we people are the life of 'spaces', we fill these spaces in order to make sense of them. <br>
        Another movie, nothing sort of post apocalyptic or societal collapse, but which has a sense of loneliness is 'Cast Away', staring legendry Tom Hanks. This movie has all the elements - death, fear, unknown and lack of resources and no preparedness. This is a survival movie, but if we closely see there could be elements of utopia, or themes touching utopia, such as living in caves, gathering food and just looking for ways to live another day in hope things would get back to normalcy.
        <br><br>
        When I think of utopia, everything is same except, there is a fear among people, a sense of urgency, even nature in its possible way trying to warn us of the stuff thats coming, dark cloud cover, Raven in the sky and a mist cover which fades the vision and a dramatic situation building, only to lead up to this chaos.

    <p>Let me leave it till here, if anytime I find anything interesting I will add it here in this section of Utopia.</p>
