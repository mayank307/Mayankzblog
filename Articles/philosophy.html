        <ul>
            <li>Recent thought : In doing a version of my interpretations of someone elses work would eventually include my resonance and biases, if I don't feel like putting out their my own stuff, I can always put out there interpretations. It keeps my personal thoughts not directly exposed and letting myself express to the limits I wanted to.</li> <hr>
            <li>Inspired by Nietzsche, I liked the idea which he published in his last work, where he divides chapters in the way a. Personality he likes, b. Personality he doesn't like c. What he condemns and what he doesn't. It seems to me as the last portrayal of ideas, giving the feeling of 'this is me, raw and unfiltered' like me or not, its who I am.</li> <hr>
            <li>I also liked Nietzsches reply, I am no ordinary men, I am a dynamite. Its such a bold and packed statement to put out there, probably men with his stature are a true dynamite, whose explosions are felt over the generations.</li> <hr>

                <h3>Evening Walk Philosophy</h3>
                <li>As a man there are three pursuits, and you have to master two of them for sure : <b>a. Money, b. Power, c. Knowledge.</b> Fetching any two will most likely get you closer to the third, but two you have to achieve on your own and that is a hard path to walk on. And I am not talking about just having a job and reading books (these things will keep you afloat), you have to become absolute in all the three domains, you are the apex. Such pursuits are difficult and hence most people will abandon it midway and will settle for ordinary, but only the true warrior will keep pushing and fighting until and unless he has it all.</li>
                <li>Knowledge aspect is likely the easy one and it can be achieved through constant perseverance, and dedication, hence we can say it is in a mans hand directly. If we are going for any 2 of the triad then Knowledge is the one we should acquire at the earliest and a must to have in our arsenal. Money initially wont come easily because the world will award you with money when you show it that you are worthy, money lies at two places a. huge amounts with elites and b. small amounts with many individuals, to get it out of elites you have to <b>'out work' them or 'out smart' them</b>, and they will reward you with riches. Second way is to add value to many peoples life and in return for the value they will give you amount which will sum up and make you rich.</li>
                <li>If you have the two : knowledge and money, most likely it will draw power towards you, either you will directly become powerful or you will have means to dictate power through powerful individual. But if you choose to go for Power directly after Knowledge then 'Politics' seems to be the way to go, it is the way to fetch absolute power. In case it seems you have no backing to gather money for Politics, you must work towards getting into bureaucratic system, it will lead you to power and there is a chance that you will likely join politics if you are noticed by the Powerful-political-lord who actually dictates rules and make things happen. Most important aspect of power is to have influence in order to get things done. </li>
                <li>I recall an example given by Ojha sir, where he says have you seen 'Kaleen Bhaiya', he is the best example of how to utilize power and keep your influence over key players.  Powerful people are calm, like Akhandanand Tripathi, there is a murder happening and everybody is uncomfortable, but he is calm and composed. Power is usually in such people's hand, who knows where their interest lies and keep working towards it, they form enemies only because of common interest, among them and their enemies. This is important to understand because 'common man' have enemies because of their ego, man with vision and power have enemies because of common goals, there is one chair/one seat and both of them wants it, hence fight begins.

                    <h4>Some other philosophical realm discussed while walking : </h4><br>
                    For Power and Money, hardwork is evident, you have to out-work everyone else in order to be crowed. Do not lose on 'Creativity' and 'Passion', often in the fast paced life we forget about these aspects but they are your friend, and will help you fight the world, it will guide you and be by your side when everyone else turns you down. Follow "1000 hr" Rule, in order to become good at something you have to invest 1000 hours into that following domain, you will either know that you are not meant for it or you will keep doing and become dominate it. And its fairly simple, everyday for 10 hrs for 100 days, or if its a side hustle then you can shift timing, and increase the number of days and there you go.
