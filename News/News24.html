Why certain events are not just events how you thought but a part of a larger landscape. Mistakes are possible, hence take everything with a pinch of salt.</h3> <br><br>

            #Bangladesh #Bengal #outcry #FreedomStruggle #Revolution<br>
            Bengal and Bangladesh has a lot to share but the origin lies in the freedom struggle during British Raj. Recent development in Bangladesh, where student groups protest led to wide spread revolution and ultimately toppling the Sheikh Hasina regime, and vandalising the statue of the founding father of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur who led the Language Movement and were pro for the preservation of culture and heritage, it shows the seeds of distress which could lead to dents in the memory of shared history between two borders.
            India must move fast and gain trust with the neighbour and its new leaders in order to keep hegemony in the region from a geopolitics pov. Delhi got blind-sided when it couldn't foresee the turmoil glooming next door, its time to for strategic movement and to quickly access the situation and act accordingly.

            #SubQuota #SupremeCourt #Reservation <br>
            The Apex court in its judgement allowed the possiblity for sub-quota within the already existing reservation for SC/ST.The Sub-Quota within the SC/ST reservations are seen differently by different groups and individual depending on where their stance are politically. Some argues that creating a sub-quota would divide the <b>marginalised</b> who are already very much fragmented while others claim that its is a much needed as their exists a creamy layer who are economically sound within the group and enjoys most of the benefits. Some argues that if the quota couldn't be filled then it would be made unreserved, and allowing a loophole for unserved to exploit it. <br>
            My opinion would definitely have bias coming from a economically stable family, and not seen the struggle to meet the day to day needs. I think there is a huge <mark>population irrespective</mark> of which caste they come from are actually poor, and social justice on the basis of just "normal reservation" has not done much to curb this. Hence moving forward with the goal of individual as well as the national interest, the only focus should be development on both levels. Getting this huge population out of poverty by any means, educating them and making them ready for nation building. We as the nation have the biggest advantage of youth population who can work, but if the youth is thinking about its ends to meet and filled with struggles beyond thinkable then he wouldn't be able to contribute more.
