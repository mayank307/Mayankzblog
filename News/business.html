    <h1>What to expect of a leader?</h1>
    <p>In this section of what to expect, we will decode all the decisions and mindset of a leader, taken from daily news. We will try to analyse the 'decision', 'anecdotes' and everything else which will help us understand the overall perspective as how to move in that direction. A decision is based on several factors and understanding those factors is essential and also to decode the person who is taking that decision, their biases and their overall perspective.</p> <hr>
